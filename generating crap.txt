can't we just say, for generation, each bit has an x% chance of being alive?
How do we generate it though? c has no default random I believe
when you get home can you find out if xc has rand?
may need to go poke simon or dan first
SSH not working
that's fine, i'll try to not spend toooo long at gym
but really want to go
Works out
Do you know where Dan's office is?
i know where simon's is
further down from david's
so on the left of the stairs
but if you want dan go ask in the school office
ticket that way, office this way
I'm pretty sure he's on the same floor somewhere
Recall seeing his name
jonny
all our lecturers are on that fucking floor
Apart from the ones that aren't
BUT THEY ALL ARE
I THINK
But there is a set of lecturers that aren't on that fucking floor
And you cannot prove that that set is empty
i mean i can
by showing that they are all on that floor
but i don't care nearly enough
You don't care enough to write out a proof? Strange days...
cause as we all know i LOVE proofs
<3
